# FAQ

## Applications

### I wanted to apply, but the deadline has passed. What should I do?

Email [dchen@mathadvance.org](mailto:dchen@mathadvance.org). I will consider late app requests on a case-by-case basis.

## Payment

## International Students

### I am an international student. Can/should I still apply?

Yes! Students out of the US are welcome to apply for the program. Do note that most materials will be tailored towards American contests, however.

### Should I include awards or contest results from my country?

It would be a good idea to. Please give me some context so I have a rough idea what they mean though; I'm from the US, so I only have US contests and international olympiads (APMO, IMO, etc) for reference.
