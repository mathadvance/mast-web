# FAQ

## Applications

### I wanted to apply, but the deadline has passed. What should I do?

Email [dchen@mathadvance.org](mailto:dchen@mathadvance.org). I will consider late app requests on a case-by-case basis.

## Payment

### Where do I pay?

See the [payment page](payment).

### How does financial aid work?

Currently the program is free, so there is no need for financial aid. When MAST transitions to a paid model, if your family cannot afford tuition, please email me. Financial resources will never be a barrier to MAST.

### Can I get financial aid because I don't want to ask my parents to pay?

No. Financial aid is only given to students whose families genuinely cannot afford the cost. Not wanting to ask your parents is not demonstrating a need for financial aid. It is demonstrating a lack of initiative.

## International Students

### I am an international student. Can/should I still apply?

Yes! Students out of the US are welcome to apply for the program. Do note that most materials will be tailored towards American contests, however.

### Should I include awards or contest results from my country?

It would be a good idea to. Please give me some context so I have a rough idea what they mean though; I'm from the US, so I only have US contests and international olympiads (APMO, IMO, etc) for reference.
