# FAQ

## Applications

### I wanted to apply, but the deadline has passed. What should I do?

Email [dchen@mathadvance.org](mailto:dchen@mathadvance.org). I will consider late app requests on a case-by-case basis.

### Why do we have to use LaTeX?

There's a lot of reasons for this.

1. LaTeX is extraordinarily useful if you plan to go into STEM. I figure I might as well encourage people to develop this skill early on.
2. I've had enough of reading poorly typeset documents, or even worse, awful handwriting.
3. LaTeX was written at a time when disk space was a luxury, not something to be wasted. Thus, the compiled PDFs are quite small, which means it will take very little disk space on my server. That saves me *money* and means I don't have to store the files elsewhere.

If you somehow manage to get a non-LaTeXed PDF under 512KB, you better have a really good reason for doing so.

## Payment

### Where do I pay?

See the [payment page](payment).

### How does financial aid work?

Currently the program is free, so there is no need for financial aid. When MAST transitions to a paid model, if your family cannot afford tuition, please email me. Financial resources will never be a barrier to MAST.

### Can I get financial aid because I don't want to ask my parents to pay?

No. Financial aid is only given to students whose families genuinely cannot afford the cost. Not wanting to ask your parents is not demonstrating a need for financial aid. It is demonstrating a lack of initiative.

## International Students

### I am an international student. Can/should I still apply?

Yes! Students out of the US are welcome to apply for the program. Do note that most materials will be tailored towards American contests, however.

### Should I include awards or contest results from my country?

It would be a good idea to. Please give me some context so I have a rough idea what they mean though; I'm from the US, so I only have US contests and international olympiads (APMO, IMO, etc) for reference.
